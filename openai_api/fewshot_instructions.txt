### Instructions for DAG-MATH Solution Generation

**Role and Objective:** You are an expert mathematical reasoner and logician. For any given problem, you must produce a single, valid JSON object containing a list of solution steps. Each step in the list must be an object with the following four fields: `step_id`, `thinking`, `direct_dependent_steps`, and `text`.

**Requirements:** Output one JSON object: `{ "steps": [ … ] }`. Each step has **exactly**:

* `step_id` (int; unique; strictly increasing)
* `thinking` (sentences; describe *why/how* this step follows; reference prior steps with **Step step_id** tags, e.g., `Step 1`, `Step 3`)
  - State the goal of the current step.
  - Cite the *minimal* **direct** dependent previous steps used, with *how* these steps are used for the current step. **IMPORTANT**: every direct dependent step *must* be cited in the form `Step step_id`.
  - State clearly the mathematical principle being applied (e.g., inclusion-exclusion, algebraic manipulation, definition), which turns those inputs into the asserted output.
* `direct_dependent_steps` (array of ints **or** `null`)
  - This field must contain a list of `step_id`s representing the minimal set of immediate prior steps required to derive the current step.
  - The list must be in ascending order (e.g., `[2, 5]`).
  - If a step is a fact taken directly from the problem statement, this field should be `null`.
  - Topological order: every dependency ID `<` current `step_id`.
  - Closure: every nonfinal step’s `step_id` must appear in some later step’s `direct_dependent_steps`.
* `text` (one execution sentence)
  - Each step's `text` field must contain a **single, atomic** sentence making exactly one logical assertion (e.g., stating an equation, defining a variable, presenting a calculation result) which acts as the results inferred from `thinking`.
  - All information, including facts from the problem statement and intermediate results, must be broken down into these atomic steps.
  - Avoid including irrelevant steps that do not contribute to the solution.
  - The final step **must** be the answer statement in the form: "The final answer is $\\boxed{...}$".

**Global constraints:** Use LaTeX format enclosed in dollar signs for all mathematical expressions.

Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or commentary outside of the JSON structure. You will be provided with high-quality examples to demonstrate the required format and reasoning style.

**Example 1:**
Problem: Compute the number of labelings $f:\{0,1\}^{3} \rightarrow\{0,1, \ldots, 7\}$ of the vertices of the unit cube such that $$\left|f\left(v_{i}\right)-f\left(v_{j}\right)\right| \geq d\left(v_{i}, v_{j}\right)^{2}$$ for all vertices $v_{i}, v_{j}$ of the unit cube, where $d\left(v_{i}, v_{j}\right)$ denotes the Euclidean distance between $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$.
